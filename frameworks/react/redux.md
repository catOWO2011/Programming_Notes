## 1. What is Redux
**Redux is a pattern and library for managing and updating application state, using events called "actions"**. It serves as a centralized store for state that needs to be across your entire application, with rules ensuring that the state can only updated in a predictable fashion.

## 2. State Managment
In a self-contained app:
* The **state**, the source of truth that drives our app.
* The **view**, a declarative description of the UI based on the current state.
* The **actions**, the events that occur in the app based on user input, and trigger updates in the state.

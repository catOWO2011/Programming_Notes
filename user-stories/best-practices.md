# Rules
## Avoid Assumptions
Verify the user story with whoever asked for it, `I would say okay, we're building this application is this what you're asking for?`, you need to be very clear to the user, make sure you verify before you start writing code, these are the things I'm gonna do.
Make sure that you come up with your plan based upon the requirements and verify all the assumptions.

## Absolute vs Relative Units

`pixel` is an absolute unit.

`rem` is a relative unit.

## Em vs Rem

* `em` units calculate their size from their parents (closest parent element), normally use this for `padding, margin`.
* `rem` units calculate their size from the root html font size otherwise it takes the browser by default it's 16px, use this for `typography`.
